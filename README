Since I used C++, you might need to install 'gcc-c++'
I used 'yum install gcc-c++', you can use an equivalent command based on your distro.

Once you execute ./makeme, it will create an executable file called 'runme'.

I have an input file by the name 'input'
 
I executed ./runme input 50 > output

So the corresponding output is in the 'output' file.

Tested for various error conditions, works perfectly. Implements Worst Fit and also coalesces adjacent holes.
